# simplenote-flutter

> A simple note-taking app using the Simplenote API

## Why

I am a big fan of the Simplenote app and love using
it to sync notes across my devices and store them.
However, I am not a big fan of web apps or anything written
in electron, so I decided to recreate the app in flutter to
get a more native feel.

This is a little practice project for me to get to know
the flutter environment and learn how to build my own flutter
apps for desktop platforms.
